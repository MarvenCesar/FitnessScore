        <h4>How was the score calculated?</h4>
        <p>The Fitness Assessment Score is calculated using a series of weighted metrics. Each of these metrics corresponds to your lifestyle choices and health habits. The final score is calculated as a percentage, giving you a clear understanding of where you stand in terms of your fitness and health. A higher score indicates a healthier lifestyle and a lower score might suggest areas that need improvement. Here's how it's calculated:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Physical Activity:</strong> Your score is influenced by how often you exercise. If you engage in physical activities 5-6 days a week, you receive the maximum score for this category. Exercising 3-4 days per week yields a slightly lower score, while exercising 1-2 days per week further reduces your score. The least amount of points are given if you exercise 0-1 day per week.</p>
        <p><strong>Caloric Intake:</strong> The match between your daily calorie intake and the recommended amount for your activity level also affects your score. Perfectly matching the recommended intake yields the maximum score, while slightly exceeding or falling short will reduce your score. Not matching the recommended caloric intake at all leads to the lowest score in this category.</p>
        <p><strong>Diet Quality:</strong> An excellent diet yields the maximum score in this category, while a good diet gives a slightly lower score. Average and poor diets reduce the score further.</p>
        <p><strong>Smoking Status:</strong> If you're a non-smoker, you receive the maximum score for this category. Being a smoker reduces your score.</p>
        <p><strong>Alcohol Consumption:</strong> Abstaining from alcohol or only drinking rarely gives you the maximum score. Drinking alcohol sometimes yields a slightly lower score, while frequent or very frequent consumption reduces your score significantly.</p>
        <p><strong>Sleep Duration:</strong> Achieving 7-8 hours or more of sleep per day gives you the maximum score. Sleeping 5-6 hours per night lowers your score, and sleeping less than 5 hours per night reduces your score further.</p>
        <p><strong>Stress Level:</strong> A low stress level gives you the maximum score, while a medium stress level reduces your score. A high stress level reduces your score further.</p>
        <p><strong>Family Health History:</strong> If there's no family history of chronic illnesses, you receive the maximum score. If there is a family history of chronic illness, your score is reduced.</p>
        <p><strong>Water Intake:</strong> Consuming 7-8 cups or more of water a day gives you the maximum score. Consuming 4-6 cups per day slightly lowers your score, and consuming less than 4 cups per day reduces your score further.</p>
